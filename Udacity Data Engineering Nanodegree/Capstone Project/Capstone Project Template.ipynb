    "#### Project Summary\n",
    "The goal of this project is to create an ETL pipeline using I94 immigration data and city temperature data to form a database that is optimized for queries on immigration events. This database can be used to answer questions relating immigration behavior to destination temperature e.g., do people tend to immigrate to warmer places?\n",

    "* Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data\n",
    "* Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data\n",
    "* Step 3: Define the Data Model\n",
    "* Step 4: Run ETL to Model the Data\n",

    "#### Scope\n",
    "In this project, we will aggregate I94 immigration data by destination city to form our first dimension table. Next we will aggregate city temperature data by city to form the second dimension table. The two datasets will be joined on destination city to form the fact table. The final database is optimized to query on immigration events to determine if temperature affects the selection of destination cities. Spark will be used to process the data.\n",

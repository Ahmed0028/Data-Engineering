# Data Engineering Nanodegree 

This repository contains material related to Udacity's [Data Engineering Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027) program. It consists a bunch of tutorial notebooks for various Data Engineering topics. In most cases, the notebooks lead you through implementing Data models, build data warehouses and data lakes, automate data pipelines, and work with massive datasets. 

There are also notebooks used as projects for the Nanodegree program. In the program itself, the projects are reviewed by Udacity experts, but they are available here as well.

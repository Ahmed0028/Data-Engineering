# Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation

This repository contains material related to Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) program. It consists of a bunch of tutorial notebooks for various deep learning topics. In most cases, the notebooks lead you through implementing models such as convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and GANs. There are other topics covered such as weight intialization and batch normalization.

There are also notebooks used as projects for the Nanodegree program. In the program itself, the projects are reviewed by Udacity experts, but they are available here as well.

## Table Of Contents

### Tutorials

* [Sentiment Analysis with Numpy](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/sentiment-network): [Andrew Trask](http://iamtrask.github.io/) leads you through building a sentiment analysis model, predicting if some text is positive or negative.
* [Intro to TensorFlow](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/intro-to-tensorflow): Starting building neural networks with Tensorflow.
* [Weight Intialization](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/weight-initialization): Explore how initializing network weights affects performance.
* [Autoencoders](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/autoencoder): Build models for image compression and denoising, using feed-forward and convolution networks in TensorFlow.
* [Transfer Learning (ConvNet)](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/transfer-learning). In practice, most people don't train their own large networkd on huge datasets, but use pretrained networks such as VGGnet. Here you'll use VGGnet to classify images of flowers without training a network on the images themselves.
* [Intro to Recurrent Networks (Character-wise RNN)](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/intro-to-rnns): Recurrent neural networks are able to use information about the sequence of data, such as the sequence of characters in text.

* [Sentiment Analysis RNN](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/sentiment-rnn): Implement a recurrent neural network that can predict if a text sample is positive or negative.
* [Tensorboard](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/tensorboard): Use TensorBoard to visualize the network graph, as well as how parameters change through training.
* [Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/reinforcement): Implement a deep Q-learning network to play a simple game from OpenAI Gym.
* [Sequence to sequence](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/seq2seq): Implement a sequence-to-sequence recurrent network.
* [Batch normalization](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/batch-norm): Learn how to improve training rates and network stability with batch normalizations.

* [Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/dcgan-svhn): Implement a DCGAN to generate new images based on the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset.
* [Intro to TFLearn](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/intro-to-tflearn): A couple introductions to a high-level library for building neural networks.
